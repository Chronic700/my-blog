## This is a Private Post

This post demonstrates how to mark content as private. 

**Note:** GitHub Pages doesn't natively support authentication. For true private pages, you'll need one of these solutions:

### Option 1: Password Protection (Client-Side)
Use a simple JavaScript-based password protection (not fully secure, but works for casual privacy).

### Option 2: Netlify Identity (Recommended)
Move to Netlify (free) which offers built-in authentication and identity management.

### Option 3: GitHub Private Repo
Keep truly private content in a separate private repository and only publish public content.

### Option 4: Custom Authentication
Use Cloudflare Access or similar service to add authentication layer.

For now, this post won't be listed on the main pages (using conditional templates).
